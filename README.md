With the advent of technology, self-driving mobile also known as Autonomous Vehicle (AV) will gradually find its way into our daily lives in the coming years. However, environmental noise such as rain will disrupt the path of the AV which may result in accidents. To eliminate such risks, many researchers have been innovating and implementing new methods to remove rain. The most recent rain removal algorithms are the ID CGAN (Image De-raining using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) & CycleGAN.
